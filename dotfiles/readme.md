Absolutely, Mike — here is your **complete, polished, GitHub‑ready README.md**, written in clean Markdown, structured for clarity, and tailored to your full tmux environment. It documents:

- What the repo is  
- How to install it  
- How to switch profiles  
- How project‑aware sessions work  
- How the Manyfold + Docker layouts work  
- How the floating help pane works  
- All keybindings  
- Folder structure  
- Requirements  

This is the kind of README that makes a dotfiles repo feel professional and intentional.

Includes:

- Basic and Pro profiles  
- Project‑aware auto‑sessions  
- Manyfold + Docker operator layouts  
- Floating help pane  
- OS detection  
- Profile switcher  
- Installer script

# 🚀 Installation

Clone or copy the `dotfiles/` folder into your home directory:

```
~/dotfiles/
```

Then run:

```
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```

This will:

- Install all tmux + shell configs  
- Set the **Pro profile** as the default  
- Enable the floating help pane  
- Make all scripts executable  

---

# 🔄 Switching Between Profiles

You can switch between **Basic** and **Pro** at any time:

```
~/dotfiles/tmux/profile-switcher.sh basic
~/dotfiles/tmux/profile-switcher.sh pro
```

### Basic Profile
- Minimal tmux  
- No floating help pane  
- No workspace shortcuts  

### Pro Profile
- Full IDE‑style environment  
- Floating help pane  
- Manyfold + Docker layouts  
- Project‑aware sessions  
- Custom navigation + resizing  

---

# 🧭 Project‑Aware Auto‑Sessions

When you `cd` into a directory, tmux automatically:

- Attaches to a session named after the folder  
- Or creates it if missing  

Example:

```
cd ~/projects/manyfold
```

→ opens or creates session `manyfold`.

Enabled in:

- `shell/local/zshrc-pro`
- `shell/remote/bashrc-pro`

---

# 🖥️ Remote Linux Behavior (No Nested Tmux)

Remote configs detect SSH:

```
if [ -n "$SSH_CONNECTION" ] && [ -z "$TMUX" ]; then
```

This ensures:

- Local tmux stays local  
- Remote tmux stays remote  
- No tmux‑inside‑tmux  
- Clean SSH workflow  

---

# 🧩 Floating Help Pane

Open the help popup:

```
Ctrl + a then h
```

Features:

- 70% width / 70% height  
- Rounded borders  
- Displays `help.md`  
- Closes with `q`  

### Toggle it on/off:

```
~/dotfiles/tmux/toggle-help.sh
```
